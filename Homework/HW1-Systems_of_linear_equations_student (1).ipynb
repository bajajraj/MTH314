    "In this problem we will revisit a problem discussed in class already, with the Giselle’s earnings as a carpenter and a blacksmith.  In this problem for week 1 she worked a total of 30 hours and earned a total of \\\\$690, where her wages as a carpenter were \\\\$20/hour and as a blacksmith were \\\\$25/hour.  This generated the following set of linear equations:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now here is the new information.  For any job, there are two parts of the time spent; work set-up and work completion.  Giselle spent $1/10$ of her work-setup time and $2/3$ of her work completion time on carpentry, so she spent $9/10$ of her work setup time and $1/3$ of her work completion time on blacksmithing.  If ```s``` is the amount of work set-up time, and ```w``` is the amount of work completion time, we get the equations:\n",
